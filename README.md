Objective: To create a website about cold plunging that provides valuable information to users and (in theory) generates affiliate income through product recommendations. Links to affiliate purchasing were not included due to the website not being optimized for web traffic (and the need to become affiliated through Amazon and "The Cold Plunge"), but links to product placeholders were included. 

The website will feature a home page acting as a route to more informative pages, a page about the benefits of cold plunging, a products page linking to recommended products, and a page concisely summarizing research on cold plunging. 

Text was summarized from numerous sources
